# 365-Widgets sensor

## Project idea
365-Widgets makes inexpensive home sensors such as thermometers, humidistats, and carbon monoxide detectors. In order to spot-check the manufacturing process, some units are put in a test environment (for an unspecified amount of time) and their readings are logged. The test environment is controlled with a known temperature, humidity, and CO concentration, but the inexpensive sensors are expected to have some variation with each reading.
